# Slum-Schools

This app records location of schools that are being run on voluntary basis. 

When you first open the app, it shows the map and zooms in on user's location, if permission is given. Then you can see location markers 
identifying the location of schools.

You can click on a marker to retrieve details about the school including name, timings, location etc

If you want to add your school to the map then you must login and fill in the required information.

All information is stored online and authentication is done via Firebase.
